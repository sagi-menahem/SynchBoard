STEP 7 SUMMARY - COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
====================================

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
Complexity analysis tools had issues with TypeScript files
This is common with TypeScript projects using modern syntax

MANUAL ASSESSMENT (based on code structure):
- Most React components are small and focused
- Custom hooks abstract complex logic well
- Canvas interaction hooks may have higher complexity (expected)
- Context providers maintain reasonable complexity
- Service layer functions are generally simple

ESTIMATED COMPLEXITY:
- Low to medium complexity overall
- Good separation of concerns
- Well-organized modular structure
